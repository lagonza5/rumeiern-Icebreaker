I put on my lederhose and finally went out the door.

It was a warm day, and as I am traveling in my BMW, I realize my Klimaalage was broken.

I decided to stop at the local Baeckerei for some Gebaeck.

I also grabbed some Brot then stole a Porsche because my BMW wasn't starting.

The Porsche not only started, but also had working klimaalage!

I drove the Porsche on the Hauptstrasse to go to Berlin.

On the way I saw Mr. Eltz walking a Hund in a Dirndel!

When I arrived in Berlin, I decided to stop at the Biergarten and they were playing Rammstein.

The Biergarten also sold bratwurst, so I ordered one at sat down at a table.

I was still so hungry that I also ordered dessert, some Apfelkuchen.
